**🧠 DI-Engineering**

**By Grounded DI**

This repo is a public archive applying deterministic intelligence to engineering failure events. Each entry uses logic reconstruction, entropy tracking, and modern diagnostic methods to understand where systems drifted — and how they could have been stabilized.

📦 Included Modules

🚀 DI Rocket Analyzer v10

🔩 DI-Engineering-002 – I-35W Bridge Collapse Reconstruction

📜 DI-Engineering-003 – LightCone Rocket Physics Simulation

📜 DI-Engineering-004 – BatteryWise Demo

🔍 Purpose

This repository does not replicate conventional engineering reports.Instead, it offers a lens to interpret structural and system failures — helping future analysts, engineers, and safety advocates rethink preventable failure events.

These archives are not legal documents or official investigations. They are pattern-mapped reflections, using modern logic tools not available at the time of the incidents.

📟 Licensing + Use

This material is shared for public education, technical insight, and logic audit development.Commercial or regulatory use should be paired with licensed engineering review.No systems were reverse-engineered in their active form.
