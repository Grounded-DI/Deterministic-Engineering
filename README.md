# 🧠 DI-Engineering  
**By Grounded DI**  
A public scroll archive applying deterministic intelligence to engineering failure events.  
Each entry uses scroll-based logic reconstruction, entropy tracking, and modern diagnostic methods to understand where systems drifted — and how they could have been stabilized.

## 📦 Included Modules

### 🚀 DI Rocket Analyzer v10  
**Deterministic Diagnostics for Aerospace System Failures**  
Module Spotlight: *Command-State Logic Misalignment Detector (CSLMD)*  
**Date:** 2025-07-22  
🧭 Purpose: Identifies command-state divergence in aerospace system loops using deterministic path mapping.  
🔒 Status: Diagnostic only. Scroll-locked for internal testing.

### 🔩 DI-Engineering-002 – *I-35W Bridge Collapse Reconstruction*  
**Title:** *Entropy Profile and Failure Chain: I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse*  
**Date:** 2025-07-27  
📍 A scroll-based reconstruction of the 2007 Minneapolis bridge failure using deterministic logic, entropy modeling, and cascade triggers.  
⚠️ Public-safe. No blame assigned. Event occurred in a different era.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository does **not replicate conventional engineering reports**.  
Instead, it offers a scroll-tier lens to interpret structural and system failures — helping future analysts, engineers, and safety advocates rethink preventable failure events.

These scrolls are **not legal documents** or official investigations.  
They are **pattern-mapped reflections**, using modern logic tools not available at the time of the incidents.

---

## 🧾 Licensing + Use

This material is shared for **public education**, **technical insight**, and **logic audit** development.  
Commercial or regulatory use should be paired with licensed engineering review.  
No systems were reverse-engineered in their active form.
