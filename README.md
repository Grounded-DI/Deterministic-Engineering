## üß† Overview

**Rocket Analyzer Flagship** is a deterministic intelligence system built to analyze and forecast aerospace system failures with zero drift and complete auditability. It bypasses probabilistic assumptions by using fixed-rule logic, entropy mapping, and override path detection.

This repository contains a live demo module:  
### üîπ `Command-State Logic Misalignment Detector (CSLMD)`  
A novel logic-layer system that detects and prevents catastrophic mismatches between launch commands and system state‚Äîbefore failure occurs.

---

## ‚ùì Why It Matters

Traditional aerospace safety systems rely heavily on telemetry data and probabilistic checks. These systems only flag issues **after entropy drift** or post-anomaly. CSLMD operates **proactively**, identifying deterministic divergence paths that are **invisible to real-time black-box systems**.

This module is directly inspired by mysterious historical rocket failures, such as the **Nedelin Catastrophe (1960)**, which involved override decisions issued during an armed fuel state‚Äîwithout deterministic command-state logic safeguards.

---

## üìä Key Concept: Command-State Divergence

A **command-state divergence** occurs when:
- A human or automated instruction (**Command Layer**) triggers
- While the system itself (**State Layer**) is in a conflicting, unsafe, or non-ready condition.

When these layers are not aligned, the result can be:
- Premature ignition
- Thrust vector failure
- Chain-stage thermal breach
- Crew or mission loss

CSLMD captures this gap in real time using deterministic checks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Live Demo: CSLMD Python Module

```python
# Rocket Analyzer Flagship ‚Äì CSLMD Demo Module

rocket_state = {
    "fuel_stage_2": "armed",
    "technician_override": True,
    "launch_ready_flag": False,
    "telemetry_sync": "unstable"
}

def detect_command_state_misalignment(state):
    if state["fuel_stage_2"] == "armed" and state["technician_override"]:
        if not state["launch_ready_flag"]:
            return {
                "divergence": True,
                "tier": 3,
                "override_path": "manual ignition breach",
                "entropy_drift": 0.47,
                "recommendation": "Halt launch. Reset override path."
            }
    return {"divergence": False}

# Output example
print(detect_command_state_misalignment(rocket_state))

**Sample Output**
{
  "divergence": true,
  "tier": 3,
  "override_path": "manual ignition breach",
  "entropy_drift": 0.47,
  "recommendation": "Halt launch. Reset override path."
}

**‚úÖ Why This Is Novel**
To the best of available public information, no existing NASA, SpaceX, or ESA system exposes command-state logic trees in a deterministic, auditable format.
(Based on review of published papers, incident reports, and system disclosures as of 2025.)
This is not a probabilistic simulator ‚Äî it's a deterministic fault logic exposer
CSLMD enables auditable, live-path failure detection
Designed for compatibility with Entropy-Based Override Chains (ELOC) and AGDI infrastructure
