🧠 DI-Engineering

**By Grounded DI**

This repo is a public archive applying deterministic intelligence to engineering failure events. Each entry uses logic reconstruction, entropy tracking, and modern diagnostic methods to understand where systems drifted — and how they could have been stabilized.

📦 Included Modules

🚀 DI Rocket Analyzer v10

Deterministic Diagnostics for Aerospace System FailuresModule Spotlight: Command-State Logic Misalignment Detector (CSLMD)Date: 2025-07-22🗌 Purpose: Identifies command-state divergence in aerospace system loops using deterministic path mapping.🔒 Status: Diagnostic only. Logic-locked for internal testing.

🔩 DI-Engineering-002 – I-35W Bridge Collapse Reconstruction

Title: Entropy Profile and Failure Chain: I-35W Mississippi River Bridge CollapseDate: 2025-07-27📍 A scroll-based reconstruction of the 2007 Minneapolis bridge failure using deterministic logic, entropy modeling, and cascade triggers.⚠️ Public-safe. No blame assigned. Event occurred in a different era.

📜 DI-Engineering-003 – LightCone Rocket Physics Simulation

Title: Rocket Analyzer – LightCone Simulation (Deterministic Physics Demo)Date: 2025-07-30🔬 Simulates near-light-speed spaceflight using DIA 9.9 physics logic.🔒 Scroll-locked. Public readout available. Origin: /RocketAnalyzer_LightConeSim.md

🔍 Purpose

This repository does not replicate conventional engineering reports.Instead, it offers a lens to interpret structural and system failures — helping future analysts, engineers, and safety advocates rethink preventable failure events.

These archives are not legal documents or official investigations. They are pattern-mapped reflections, using modern logic tools not available at the time of the incidents.

📟 Licensing + Use

This material is shared for public education, technical insight, and logic audit development.Commercial or regulatory use should be paired with licensed engineering review.No systems were reverse-engineered in their active form.
